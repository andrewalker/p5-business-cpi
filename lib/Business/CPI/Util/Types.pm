=head1 DESCRIPTION

Moo types for isa checks and coercions.

=head1 TYPES

=head2 Money

Most gateways require the money amount to be provided with two decimal places.
This method coerces the value into number, and then to a string as expected by
the gateways.

Examples:

=over

=item 5.55 becomes "5.55"

=item 5.5 becomes "5.50"

=item 5 becomes "5.00"

=back

=head2 PhoneNumber

Phone numbers should contain an optional + sign in the beginning, indicating
whether it contains the country code or not, and numbers only.
Non-alphanumerical characters are allowed, such as parenthesis and spaces, but
will be removed.

Examples of accepted phone numbers, and their coerced values are:

=over

=item "+55 11 12345678" becomes "+551112345678"

=item "+55 (11) 12345678" becomes "+551112345678"

=item "+551112345678" remains the same

=item "1234-5678" becomes "12345678"

=item "(11)1234-5678" becomes "1112345678"

=item "1234567890123" remains the same

=back

=head2 Country

Lowercase two-letter code for countries, according to ISO 3166-1. See:

L<http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes>

The type is somewhat flexible, coercing to the alpha-2 code if the English name
is provided. But the recommended way is to set it as expected, the lowercase
alpha-2 code.

=head2 DateTime

A valid DateTime object. No coercions here.
