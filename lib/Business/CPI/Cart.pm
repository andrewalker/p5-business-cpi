=head1 DESCRIPTION

Cart class for holding products to be purchased. Don't instantiate this
directly, use L<Business::CPI::Gateway::Base/new_cart> to build it.

=attr id

The id of the cart, if your application has one set for it.

=attr gateway_id

The id your gateway has set for this cart, if there is one.

=attr buyer

The person paying for the shopping cart. See L<Business::CPI::Buyer>.

=attr discount

Discount to be applied to the total amount. Positive number.

=attr tax

Tax to be applied to the total amount. Positive number.

=attr handling

Handling to be applied to the total amount. Positive number.

=method add_item

Create a new Business::CPI::Item object with the given hashref, and add it to
cart.

=method get_item

Get item with the given id.

=method get_form_to_pay

Takes a payment_id as the only argument, and returns an HTML::Element form, to
submit to the gateway.

=method get_checkout_code

Very similar to get_form_to_pay, C<< $cart->get_checkout_code >> will send to
the gateway this cart, and return a token for it, so that the payment will be
made referring to this token. It receives the same arguments as
get_form_to_pay.
