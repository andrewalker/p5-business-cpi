__END__

=attr driver_name

The name of the driver for this gateway. This is built automatically, but can
be customized.

Example: for C<Business::CPI::Gateway::TestGateway>, the driver name will be
C<TestGateway>.

=attr log

Provide a logger to the gateway. It's the user's responsibility to configure
the logger. By default, nothing is logged. You could set this to a
L<Log::Log4perl> object, for instance, to get full logging.

=attr item_class

The class for the items (products) being purchased. Defaults to
Business::CPI::${driver_name}::Item if it exists, or
L<Business::CPI::Base::Item> otherwise.

=attr cart_class

The class for the shopping cart (the complete order). Defaults to
Business::CPI::${driver_name}::Cart if it exists, or
L<Business::CPI::Base::Cart> otherwise.

=attr buyer_class

The class for the buyer (the sender). Defaults to
Business::CPI::${driver_name}::Buyer if it exists, or
L<Business::CPI::Base::Buyer> otherwise.

=attr account_class

The class for the accounts. Defaults to Business::CPI::${driver_name}::Account
if it exists, or L<Business::CPI::Base::Account> otherwise.

=attr account_address_class

The class for the addresses for the accounts. Defaults to
Business::CPI::${driver_name}::Account::Address if it exists, or
L<Business::CPI::Base::Account::Address> otherwise.

=attr account_business_class

The class for the business information of accounts. Defaults to
Business::CPI::${driver_name}::Account::Business if it exists, or
L<Business::CPI::Base::Account::Business> otherwise.

=attr receiver_id

ID, login or e-mail of the business owner. The way the gateway uniquely
identifies the account owner.

=attr currency

Currency code, such as BRL, EUR, USD, etc.

=attr notification_url

The url for the gateway to postback, notifying payment changes.

=attr return_url

The url for the customer to return to, after they finished the payment.

=attr checkout_with_token

Boolean attribute to determine whether the form will hold the entire cart, or
it will use the payment token generated for it. Defaults to false.

=attr checkout_url

The url the application will post the form to. Defined by the gateway.

=attr user_agent

User agent object (using L<LWP::UserAgent>'s API) to make requests to the gateway.

=attr error

Whenever an exception is thrown, this attribute will also hold the exception
object. This is because $@ may be overwritten before the exception is handled.

So one can use:

    try {
        # do something that will trigger an exception
        $cpi->get_cart('something that doesnt exist');
    }
    catch {
        if ($cpi->error->type eq 'resource_not_found') {
            warn "Oops, it doesn't exist.";
        }

        # $cpi->error is the same as $_ and $_[0], unless someone messed up
        # with $@, e.g., using $SIG{__DIE__} or something nasty like that. In
        # that case, $_ is lost, but $cpi->error is safe.
    }

=attr most_recent_request

Whenever a request is made to the gateway, this attribute will hold the
HTTP::Response object returned by the request.

B<Note:> this is meant to be used for custom logging in the application.
Usually, it's better to keep all the request-related details handled by
Business::CPI, and abstract all the low-level details to the user. That
includes logging, for the most part. The object returned by each method
implemented by Business::CPI should be enough in most cases.

If you find yourself having to use this attribute too much, it probably means
that gateway's Business::CPI driver is not doing what it should.

=method new_cart

Creates a new L<Business::CPI::Role::Cart> connected to this gateway.

=method new_account

Creates a new instance of an account. In general, you shouldn't need to use
this, except for testing. Use C<create_account>, instead, if your driver
provides it.

=method get_checkout_code

Generates a payment token for a given cart. Do not call this method directly.
Instead, see L<Business::CPI::Role::Cart/get_checkout_code>.

=method get_notification_details

Get the payment notification (such as PayPal's IPN), and return a hashref with
the details.

=method query_transactions

Search past transactions.

=method get_transaction_details

Get more details about a given transaction.

=method notify

This is supposed to be called when the gateway sends a notification about a
payment status change to the application. Receives the request as a parameter
(in a CGI-compatible format), and returns data about the payment. The format is
still under discussion, and is soon to be documented.

=method map_object

Helper method for get_hidden_inputs to translate between Business::CPI and the
gateway, using methods like checkout_form_items_map, checkout_form_buyer_map,
etc.
