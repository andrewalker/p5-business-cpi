=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class holds information about the buyer in a shopping cart. The address
attributes are available so that if shipping is required, the buyer's address
will be passed to the gateway (if the attributes were set).

=attr email

Buyer's e-mail, which usually is their unique identifier in the gateway.

=attr name

Buyer's name.

=attr address_line1

=attr address_line2

Some gateways (such as PayPal) do not define the street address as specific
separate fields (such as Street, Number, District, etc). Instead, they only
accept two address lines. For our purposes, we define a lazy builder for these
attributes in case they are not directly set, using the specific fields
mentioned above.

=attr address_street

Street name for shipping.

=attr address_number

Address number for shipping.

=attr address_district

District name.

=attr address_complement

If any extra information is required to find the address set this field.

=attr address_zip_code

Postal code.

=attr address_city

City.

=attr address_state

State.

=attr address_country

Locale::Country code for the country. You can set using the ISO 3166-1
two-letter code, or the full name in English. It will coerce it and store the
ISO 3166-1 two-letter code.
